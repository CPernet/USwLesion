  abstract = {Spinal neurodegeneration is an important determinant of disability
	progression in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
	Advanced imaging techniques, such as single-voxel (1)H-magnetic resonance
	spectroscopy and q-space imaging, have increased pathological specificity
	for neurodegeneration, but are challenging to implement in the spinal
	cord and have yet to be applied in early primary progressive multiple
	sclerosis. By combining these imaging techniques with new clinical
	measures, which reflect spinal cord pathology more closely than conventional
	clinical tests, we explored the potential for spinal magnetic resonance
	spectroscopy and q-space imaging to detect early spinal neurodegeneration
	that may be responsible for clinical disability. Data from 21 patients
	with primary progressive multiple sclerosis within 6 years of disease
	onset, and 24 control subjects were analysed. Patients were clinically
	assessed on grip strength, vibration perception thresholds and postural
	stability, in addition to the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Nine
	Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, Multiple Sclerosis Walking
	Scale-12, and Modified Ashworth Scale. All subjects underwent magnetic
	resonance spectroscopy and q-space imaging of the cervical cord and
	conventional brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T.
	Multivariate analyses and multiple regression models were used to
	assess the differences in imaging measures between groups and the
	relationship between magnetic resonance imaging measures and clinical
	scores, correcting for age, gender, spinal cord cross-sectional area,
	brain T2 lesion volume, and brain white matter and grey matter volume
	fractions. Although patients did not show significant cord atrophy
	when compared with healthy controls, they had significantly lower
	total N-acetyl-aspartate (mean 4.01 versus 5.31 mmol/l, P = 0.020)
	and glutamate-glutamine (mean 4.65 versus 5.93 mmol/l, P = 0.043)
	than controls. Patients showed an increase in q-space imaging-derived
	indices of perpendicular diffusivity in both the whole cord and major
	columns compared with controls (P < 0.05 for all indices). Lower
	total N-acetyl-aspartate was associated with higher disability, as
	assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (coefficient = -0.41,
	0.01 < P < 0.05), Modified Ashworth Scale (coefficient = -3.78, 0.01
	< P < 0.05), vibration perception thresholds (coefficient = -4.37,
	P = 0.021) and postural sway (P < 0.001). Lower glutamate-glutamine
	predicted increased postural sway (P = 0.017). Increased perpendicular
	diffusivity in the whole cord and columns was associated with increased
	scores on the Modified Ashworth Scale, vibration perception thresholds
	and postural sway (P < 0.05 in all cases). These imaging findings
	indicate reduced structural integrity of neurons, demyelination,
	and abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways in the cervical cord
	of early primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in the absence of
	extensive spinal cord atrophy. The observed relationship between
	imaging measures and disability suggests that early spinal neurodegeneration
	may underlie clinical impairment, and should be targeted in future
	clinical trials with neuroprotective agents to prevent the development
	of progressive disability.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to explore the possibilities of multi-parametric
	representations of voxel-wise quantitative MRI data to objectively
	discriminate pathological cerebral tissue in patients with brain
	disorders. For this purpose, we recruited 19 patients with Multiple
	Sclerosis (MS) as benchmark samples and 19 age and gender matched
	healthy subjects as a reference group. The subjects were examined
	using quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measuring the
	tissue structure parameters: relaxation rates, R(1) and R(2), and
	proton density. The resulting parameter images were normalized to
	a standard template. Tissue structure in MS patients was assessed
	by voxel-wise comparisons with the reference group and with correlation
	to a clinical measure, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
	The results were visualized by conventional geometric representations
	and also by multi-parametric representations. Data showed that MS
	patients had lower R(1) and R(2), and higher proton density in periventricular
	white matter and in wide-spread areas encompassing central and sub-cortical
	white matter structures. MS-related tissue abnormality was highlighted
	in posterior white matter whereas EDSS correlation appeared especially
	in the frontal cortex. The multi-parameter representation highlighted
	disease-specific features. In conclusion, the proposed method has
	the potential to visualize both high-probability focal anomalies
	and diffuse tissue changes. Results from voxel-based statistical
	analysis, as exemplified in the present work, may guide radiologists
	where in the image to inspect for signs of disease. Future clinical
	studies must validate the usability of the method in clinical practice.},

	(WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial
	criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease.
	Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time
	and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize
	user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated
	lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo
	(GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines
	the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal
	fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity
	distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which
	are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief
	is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring
	voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions.
	This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to
	lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed
	against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our
	algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10
	patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that
	were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands).
	We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing
	(R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to
	6mm). These results require validation with data from other protocols
	based on a conventional FLAIR sequence and a 3D GRE T1-weighted sequence.
	Yet, we believe that our tool allows fast and reliable segmentation
	of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions, which might simplify the quantification
	of lesions in basic research and even clinical trials.},

  abstract = {To present a method for generating reference maps of typical brain
	characteristics of groups of subjects using a novel combination of
	rapid quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) and brain normalization.
	The reference maps can be used to detect significant tissue differences
	in patients, both locally and globally.A rapid qMRI method was used
	to obtain the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), the transverse relaxation
	rate (R2) and the proton density (PD). These three tissue properties
	were measured in the brains of 32 healthy subjects and in one patient
	diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The maps were normalized
	to a standard brain template using a linear affine registration.
	The differences of the mean value ofR1, R2 and PD of 31 healthy subjects
	in comparison to the oldest healthy subject and in comparison to
	an MS patient were calculated. Larger anatomical structures were
	characterized using a standard atlas. The vector sum of the normalized
	differences was used to show significant tissue differences.The coefficient
	of variation of the reference maps was high at the edges of the brain
	and the ventricles, moderate in the cortical grey matter and low
	in white matter and the deep grey matter structures. The elderly
	subject mainly showed significantly lower R1 and R2 and higher PD
	values along all sulci. The MS patient showed significantly lower
	R1 and R2 and higher PD values at the edges of the ventricular system
	as well as throughout the periventricular white matter, at the internal
	and external capsules and at each of the MS lesions.Brain normalization
	of rapid qMRI is a promising new method to generate reference maps
	of typical brain characteristics and to automatically detect deviating
	tissue properties in the brain.},

  abstract = {The administration of gadolinium contrast agent is a common part of
	MR imaging examinations in patients with MS. The presence of gadolinium
	may affect the outcome of automated tissue classification. The purpose
	of this study was to investigate the effects of the presence of gadolinium
	on the automatic segmentation in patients with MS by using the synthetic
	tissue-mapping method.A cohort of 20 patients with clinically definite
	multiple sclerosis were recruited, and the T1 and T2 relaxation times
	and proton density were simultaneously quantified before and after
	the administration of gadolinium. Synthetic tissue-mapping was used
	to measure white matter, gray matter, CSF, brain parenchymal, and
	intracranial volumes. For comparison, 20 matched controls were measured
	twice, without gadolinium.No differences were observed for the control
	group between the 2 measurements. For the MS group, significant changes
	were observed pre- and post-gadolinium in intracranial volume (-13
	mL, P < .005) and cerebrospinal fluid volume (-16 mL, P < .005) and
	the remaining, unclassified non-WM/GM/CSF tissue volume within the
	intracranial volume (+8 mL, P < .05). The changes in the patient
	group were much smaller than the differences, compared with the controls,
	which were -129 mL for WM volume, -22 mL for GM volume, +91 mL for
	CSF volume, 24 mL for the remaining, unclassified non-WM/GM/CSF tissue
	volume within the intracranial volume, and -126 mL for brain parenchymal
	volume. No significant differences were observed for linear regression
	values against age and Expanded Disability Status Scale.The administration
	of gadolinium contrast agent had a significant effect on automatic
	brain-tissue classification in patients with MS by using synthetic
	tissue-mapping. The observed differences, however, were much smaller
	than the group differences between MS and controls.},
